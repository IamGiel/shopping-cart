This web application is for a client that wants to have his own web app where he can sell his stuff.  The MVP should have:

* Display the Items he has with photo and its price.
* User can login/logout and make purchase.
* Have profile page
* Purchase history
* Track transactions
* Ability to charge a credit cardf/ATM
* In the future, allow users to do the same (but for now its only the clients personal site for selling his own stuff).
